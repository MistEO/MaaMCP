## Introduction

MaaMCP is a Model Context Protocol server that exposes MaaFramework's powerful automation capabilities through standardized MCP interfaces to AI assistants (like Claude). With this server, AI assistants can:

- 🤖 **Android Automation** - Connect and control Android devices/emulators via ADB
- 🖥️ **Windows Automation** - Control Windows desktop applications
  - 🎯 **Background Operation** - Screenshots and controls on Windows run in the background without occupying your mouse or keyboard, allowing you to continue using your computer for other tasks
- 🔗 **Multi-Device Coordination** - Control multiple devices/windows simultaneously for cross-device automation
- 👁️ **Smart Recognition** - Use OCR to recognize on-screen text
- 🎯 **Precise Operations** - Execute clicks, swipes, text input, key presses, and more
- 📸 **Screenshots** - Capture real-time screenshots for visual analysis

Talk is cheap, see: **[🎞️ Bilibili Video Demo](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1eGmhBaEZz/)**

  - On Android, simulates system keys: Back(4), Home(3), Menu(82), Volume keys, etc.
  - On Windows, supports virtual key codes: Enter(13), ESC(27), Arrow keys, etc.
- `keyboard_shortcut` - Keyboard shortcuts
  - Supports key combinations: Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, Alt+Tab, etc.
- `scroll` - Mouse wheel (Windows only)

### 📝 Pipeline Generation & Execution

- `get_pipeline_protocol` - Get Pipeline protocol documentation
- `save_pipeline` - Save Pipeline JSON to file (supports creating and updating)
- `load_pipeline` - Load an existing Pipeline file
- `run_pipeline` - Run Pipeline and return execution results
- `open_pipeline_in_browser` - Open Pipeline visualization in browser

## Quick Start

### Installation

#### Option 1: Install via pip (Recommended)

```bash
pip install maa-mcp
```

#### Option 2: Install from source

1. **Clone the repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MistEO/MaaMCP.git
    cd MaaMCP
    ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**

    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```

### Configure Clients

Add an MCP server to software such as Cursor:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "MaaMCP": {
      "command": "maa-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

OR

Add an MCP command to software such as Cherry Studio:

```shell
maa-mcp
```

## Usage Examples

After configuration, you can use it:

**Android Automation Example:**

```text
Please use the MaaMCP tools to connect to my Android device, open Meituan, and help me order a Chinese meal (one portion) around 20 RMB.
```

**Windows Automation Example:**

```text
Please use the MaaMCP tools to show me how to add a rotation animation effect to the current PPT slide, and demonstrate the steps.
```

**Pipeline Generation Example:**

```text
Please use MaaMCP tools to connect to my device, help me open Settings, go to Display settings, and adjust brightness to 50%.
After completing the operations, generate a Pipeline JSON for this workflow so it can be run directly later.
```

MaaMCP will automatically:

1. Scan available devices/windows
2. Establish connection
3. Auto-download and load OCR resources (on first use)
4. Execute recognition and operation tasks

## Prompt words

If you want AI to complete automation tasks quickly and efficiently without seeing detailed explanations during the running process, you can add the following content to your prompt:

```
# Role: UI Automation Agent

## Workflow Optimization Rules
1. **Minimize Round-Trips**: Your goal is to complete tasks with the fewest interactions.
2. **Critical Pattern**: When it comes to form/chat input, you must follow the **[Click Focus -> Input Text -> Send Key]** atomic operation sequence.
   - 🚫 Wrong way: Click first, wait for results; then Input, wait for results; then Press Enter.
   - ✅ Correct way: After `click`, without waiting for a return, directly append `input_text` and `click_key` in the same `tool_calls` list based on logical inference.

## Communication Style
- **NO YAPPING**: Don't repeat user instructions, don't explain your steps.
- **Direct Execution**: Receive instructions -> (internal thinking) -> directly output JSON tool calls.
- **Direct Execution**: Receive instruction -> (internal thinking) -> directly output JSON tool calls.
```

### Performance Recommendations

For the fastest running speed, it is recommended to use **Flash version** of large language models (such as Claude 3 Flash), which can significantly improve response speed while maintaining high intelligence levels.

## Workflow

MaaMCP follows a streamlined operational workflow with multi-device/window coordination support:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Scan Devices] --> B[Establish Connection]
    B --> C[Execute Automation]
```

1. **Scan** - Use `find_adb_device_list` or `find_window_list`
2. **Connect** - Use `connect_adb_device` or `connect_window` (can connect multiple devices/windows, each gets a unique controller ID)
3. **Operate** - Execute OCR, click, swipe, etc. on multiple devices/windows by specifying different controller IDs (OCR resources auto-download on first use)

## Pipeline Generation

MaaMCP supports AI converting executed operations into [MaaFramework Pipeline](https://maafw.xyz/docs/3.1-PipelineProtocol) JSON format, enabling **operate once, reuse infinitely**.

### How It Works

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[AI Executes Operations] --> B[Operations Completed]
    B --> C[AI Reads Pipeline Docs]
    C --> D[AI Intelligently Generates Pipeline]
    D --> E[Save JSON File]
    E --> F[Run Validation]
    F --> G{Success?}
    G -->|Yes| H[Done]
    G -->|No| I[Analyze Failure]
    I --> J[Modify Pipeline]
    J --> F
```

1. **Execute Operations** - AI performs OCR, clicks, swipes, and other automation operations normally
2. **Get Documentation** - Call `get_pipeline_protocol` to get the Pipeline protocol specification
3. **Intelligent Generation** - AI converts **valid operations** into Pipeline JSON based on the documentation
4. **Save File** - Call `save_pipeline` to save the generated Pipeline
5. **Run Validation** - Call `run_pipeline` to verify the Pipeline works correctly
6. **Iterative Optimization** - Analyze failures and modify Pipeline until successful

### Advantages of Intelligent Generation

Unlike mechanical recording, AI intelligent generation offers these advantages:

- **Only Keeps Successful Paths**: If multiple paths were tried during operation (e.g., first entering Menu A without finding the target, then returning and entering Menu B to find it), AI will only keep the final successful path, removing failed attempts
- **Understands Operation Intent**: AI can understand the purpose of each operation and generate semantically clear node names
- **Optimizes Recognition Conditions**: Intelligently sets recognition regions and matching conditions based on OCR results
- **Validation & Iteration**: Discovers issues through run validation, automatically fixes and enhances robustness

### Validation & Iterative Optimization

After Pipeline generation, AI automatically validates and optimizes:

1. **Run Validation** - Execute Pipeline to check if it succeeds
2. **Failure Analysis** - If failed, analyze which node failed and why
3. **Intelligent Fixes** - Common optimization techniques:
   - Add alternative recognition nodes (add multiple candidates in next list)
   - Relax OCR matching conditions (use regex or partial matching)
   - Adjust roi recognition regions
   - Add wait time (post_delay)
   - Add intermediate state detection nodes
4. **Re-validate** - Run again after modifications until it consistently succeeds

If the Pipeline logic itself needs adjustment, AI can re-execute automation operations and combine old and new experiences to generate a more robust Pipeline.

  },
  "AdjustBrightness": {
    "recognition": "OCR",
    "expected": "Brightness",
    "action": "Swipe",
    "begin": [200, 500],
    "end": [400, 500],
    "duration": 200
  }
}
```

## Notes

📌 **Windows Automation Limitations**:

- Some games or applications with anti-cheat mechanisms may block background control operations
- If the target application runs with administrator privileges, MaaMCP must also be launched with administrator privileges
- Minimized windows are not supported; please keep the target window in a non-minimized state
- If the default background screenshot/input methods are unavailable (e.g., empty screenshots, unresponsive operations), the AI assistant may attempt to switch to foreground methods, which will occupy the mouse and keyboard

## FAQ

### OCR recognition fails with "Failed to load det or rec" or prompts that resources do not exist

On first use, OCR model files will be automatically downloaded. However, download failures may occur. Please check the data directory:

- Windows: `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\MaaMCP\resource\model\ocr\`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/MaaMCP/resource/model/ocr/`
- Linux: `~/.local/share/MaaMCP/resource/model/ocr/`

1. Check if model files exist in the above directory (`det.onnx`, `rec.onnx`, `keys.txt`)
2. Check for resource download errors in `model/download.log`
3. Manually run `python -c "from maa_mcp.download import download_and_extract_ocr; download_and_extract_ocr()"` to retry downloading

### About Issues

When filing an issue, please provide log files. The log file path is as follows:

- Windows: `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\MaaMCP\debug\maa.log`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/MaaMCP/debug/maa.log`
- Linux: `~/.local/share/MaaMCP/debug/maa.log`
